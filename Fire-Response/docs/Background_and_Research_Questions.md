## Research Background:

* ### Problem Situation:
The main stakeholders are the fire department employees, officials, and individuals who live or frequently commute within the fire department’s response territory. The setting for our problem is that fire department members and officials care about people’s safety and want to improve their ability to quickly dispatch. People who live, travel and commute around the U-District may also want to acquire information about the level of safety regarding fire incidents. Fire departments want to utilize their resources to be as prepared as possible for any possible incidents. It is likely that certain areas are more or less prone to emergencies and require more or less attention from the fire department.

* ### What is the problem?
With the unpredictability of fire calls, it is hard for fire department members and officials to predict when they will receive calls and where the incident will occur. This has the potential to delay incident response times, especially when experiencing a high volume of calls. Civilians who live in this area are directly affected by how well the fire department responds, and more cautious citizens may use the information in planning where they spend their time.

* ### Why does it matter?
If fire department members and officials use organized information on fire calls they can predict which locations are of higher risk and pay more attention to that location, thus improving their ability to respond to emergency situations as soon as possible. If people who live in and travel around the area acquire organized information of fire calls, they can use caution in specific locations and timely adjust their living plans to improve their safety.

* ### How it will be addressed?
We plan to create data visualizations that show various information on fire calls in the U-District area, such as the number of fire calls received, locations of fire calls, and frequency of fire calls at different times of day. We also plan to compare the frequency of non-fire incidents that occurred in the area relative to fire incidents. Additionally, we will demonstrate how data about fire calls can help fire department members and officials solve challenges by reaching a data-driven solution.

## Research Questions:
* _What parts of the U-district are at higher risk of incidents necessitating a fire call? What about at different times of the year?_
* _What categories of fire call incidents are most common, and how is this changing?_
